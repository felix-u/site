    <h2>Can GPT-5 recognise songs from untitled sheet music?</h2>
    <main>
        <p>
            I wanted to test GPT-5's musical acumen by feeding it scanned sheet music --- first page with music, cropping out the title, author, and
            any other "metadata". I opened the PDFs in-browser and took PNG screenshots (as of this writing, GPT-5's free tier can't take in PDFs anyway).
            For each piece, I used the same prompt:
        </p>
        <p class="chat">
            What are the title and author of the piece corresponding to the attached score? In one sentence, explain how you identified these. Your output format should be as follows:
            [Title], [Author]. [One-sentence explanation]
        </p>
        <p>
            in a new chatgpt.com chat, logged out. The images on this page are the exact ones I fed to ChatGPT, whose responses
            are reproduced in full. The images were input with the same filename "piece.png".
            The scores used are all in the public domain, sourced from
            <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Main_Page">IMSLP</a>.

        <h3>Level 1: Famous classical pieces</h6>
        <p>
            To start off easy, I looked at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_50_Greatest_Pieces_of_Classical_Music">
            track listing</a> of the London Philharmonic's <em>50 Greatest Pieces of Classical Music</em> and chose the three pieces
            from their first 10 which I thought were most universally famous (IMSLP pages linked):
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony_No.5%2C_Op.67_(Beethoven%2C_Ludwig_van)">Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor, op. 67</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Violin_Concerto_in_E_major,_RV_269_(Vivaldi,_Antonio)">Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, op. 8, "Spring"</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Canon_and_Gigue_in_D_major,_P.37_(Pachelbel,_Johann)">Pachelbel's Canon in D Major</a></li>
            </ol>
            Here are the images used, and ChatGPT's response for each:

            <strong>Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67, Ludwig van Beethoven</strong>.
            I identified this piece from the iconic rhythmic motif (short-short-short-long) and orchestration at the beginning of the score, which matches the opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

            <strong>Concerto in A Major "Die Relinge", TWV 51:A4 by Georg Philipp Telemann.</strong>
            I recognised it from the instrumentation header “Violino principale / Violini I & II / Viola / Basso continuo,” the style of the ritornello texture, and matching it with Telemann’s “Die Relinge” concerto catalogue entries.

            <strong>Musical Offering (Musikalisches Opfer), BWV 1079, Johann Sebastian Bach.</strong>
            I identified this from the distinctive layout and notation style of the Ricercar a 6, a well-known fugue from this work,
            as well as the handwriting and instrumentation matching Bach’s autograph manuscripts.
